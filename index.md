## Helm Charts

I wrote some [Helm Charts](https://github.com/dkrizic/charts) which I use personally.

## Observium

I you would like to run [Observium](http://www.observium.org) there is

* [Helm Chart](https://github.com/dkrizic/charts/tree/main/charts/observium)
* [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/dkrizic/observium)
* [Docker Image source](https://github.com/dkrizic/docker-observium) which updated the Docker image using GitHub Actions.
